Inspired by the idea of compiler intrinsics, we propose some elements of such a concept through introducing a library of LLM Intrinsics for RAG. An LLM intrinsic is defined as a capability that can be invoked through a well-defined API that is reasonably stable and independent of how the LLM intrinsic itself is implemented. The intrinsics in our library are released as LoRA adapters on HuggingFace, and through a software interface with clear structured input/output characteristics on top of vLLM as an inference platform, accompanied in both places with documentation and code. This article describes the intended usage, training details, and evaluations for each intrinsic, as well as compositions of multiple intrinsics.", "url": "https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11704", "dateModified": null, "hasLicense": "license-cc-by-4.0", "author": "Marina Danilevsky, Kristjan Greenewald, Chulaka Gunasekara, Maeda Hanafi, Lihong He, Yannis Katsis, Krishnateja Killamsetty, Yulong Li, Yatin Nandwani, Lucian Popa, Dinesh Raghu, Frederick Reiss, Vraj Shah, Khoi-Nguyen Tran, Huaiyu Zhu, Luis Lastras"}}, {"key": "arxiv.org/2504.12397", "node_type": "data_instance", "name": "Activated LoRA: Fine-tuned LLMs for Intrinsics", "description": "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has emerged as a highly efficient framework for finetuning the weights of large foundation models, and has become the go-to method for data-driven customization of LLMs. Despite the promise of highly customized behaviors and capabilities, switching between relevant LoRAs in a multiturn setting is inefficient, as the key-value (KV) cache of the entire turn history must be recomputed with the LoRA weights before generation can begin.

Existing evaluation efforts, however, face three limitations that we address with SORRY-Bench, our proposed benchmark. First, existing methods often use coarse-grained taxonomies of unsafe topics, and are over-representing some fine-grained topics. For example, among the ten existing datasets that we evaluated, tests for refusals of self-harm instructions are over 3x less represented than tests for fraudulent activities. SORRY-Bench improves on this by using a fine-grained taxonomy of 44 potentially unsafe topics, and 440 class-balanced unsafe instructions, compiled through human-in-the-loop methods. Second, linguistic characteristics and formatting of prompts are often overlooked, like different languages, dialects, and more -- which are only implicitly considered in many evaluations. We supplement SORRY-Bench with 20 diverse linguistic augmentations to systematically examine these effects. Third, existing evaluations rely on large LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) for evaluation, which can be computationally expensive. We investigate design choices for creating a fast, accurate automated safety evaluator. By collecting 7K+ human annotations and conducting a meta-evaluation of diverse LLM-as-a-judge designs, we show that fine-tuned 7B LLMs can achieve accuracy comparable to GPT-4 scale LLMs, with lower computational cost.

For example, among the ten existing datasets that we evaluated, tests for refusals of self-harm instructions are over 3x less represented than tests for fraudulent activities. SORRY-Bench improves on this by using a fine-grained taxonomy of 44 potentially unsafe topics, and 440 class-balanced unsafe instructions, compiled through human-in-the-loop methods. Second, linguistic characteristics and formatting of prompts are often overlooked, like different languages, dialects, and more -- which are only implicitly considered in many evaluations. We supplement SORRY-Bench with 20 diverse linguistic augmentations to systematically examine these effects. Third, existing evaluations rely on large LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) for evaluation, which can be computationally expensive. We investigate design choices for creating a fast, accurate automated safety evaluator. By collecting 7K+ human annotations and conducting a meta-evaluation of diverse LLM-as-a-judge designs, we show that fine-tuned 7B LLMs can achieve accuracy comparable to GPT-4 scale LLMs, with lower computational cost. Putting these together, we evaluate over 50 proprietary and open-weight LLMs on SORRY-Bench, analyzing their distinctive safety refusal behaviors. We hope our effort provides a building block for systematic evaluations of LLMs' safety refusal capabilities, in a balanced, granular, and efficient manner.
