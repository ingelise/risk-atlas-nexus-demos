# Auto-BenchmarkCard: Automated Synthesis of Benchmark Documentation

We present Auto-BenchmarkCard, a workflow for generating validated descriptions of AI benchmarks. Benchmark documentation is often incomplete or inconsistent, making it difficult to interpret and compare benchmarks across tasks or domains. Auto-BenchmarkCard addresses this gap by combining multi-agent data extraction from heterogeneous sources (e.g., Hugging Face, Unitxt, academic papers) with LLM-driven synthesis. A subsequent validation phase evaluates factual accuracy through atomic entailment scoring using the FactReasoner tool. The workflow promotes transparency, comparability, and reusability in AI benchmark reporting, enabling researchers and practitioners to better navigate and evaluate benchmark choices.

The system automates the creation of benchmark documentation through a three-phase workflow.

**Extraction Phase:** The workflow aggregates metadata from multiple sources including Unitxt, Hugging Face, and academic papers, extracting benchmark identifiers, dataset information, and documentation.

**Composing Phase:** An LLM-powered composer synthesizes all extracted information into a structured BenchmarkCard, intelligently combining the extracted data into cohesive documentation. Based on that BenchmarkCard, AI Atlas Nexus tags potential risks associated with it.

**Validation Phase:** The generated card is broken down into atomic claims. Search algorithms retrieve relevant evidence for each claim from the extraction phase data, which an LLM reranks and filters for quality. These claim-evidence pairs are then sent to FactReasoner, which classifies them as supported, contradicted, or neutral with confidence scores. Sections with low factuality scores or missing evidence are flagged for human review through the BenchmarkCard Editor, enabling iterative refinement until publication-ready documentation is achieved.

Each component acts as a "worker" in the LangGraph workflow, with graph state updated at each stage to maintain seamless data flow throughout the pipeline.

## Output Structure

The system creates a timestamped, organized directory structure for each benchmark processing session:

```
output/
└── <benchmark_name>_<timestamp>/
    ├── tool_output/                 # All tool outputs and analysis results
    │   ├── unitxt/                  # UnitXT benchmark definitions
    │   ├── hf/                      # Hugging Face dataset metadata
    │   ├── docling/                 # Processed academic papers
    │   ├── extractor/               # Extracted IDs and URLs
    │   ├── risk_enhanced/           # Risk-enhanced benchmark cards
    │   ├── rag/                     # Evidence retrieval and atomic statements
    │   ├── factreasoner/            # Factuality verification scores
    │   └── ai_atlas_nexus/        # AI risk assessment results
    └── auto_benchmarkcard/               # Final benchmark cards
        └── benchmark_card_<name>.json         # Complete card with flagged fields section
```

Example session directory: `output/hellaswag_2025-01-08_14-30/`

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9+
- macOS with Homebrew (for Merlin compilation)
- Git

---

## Setup Instructions

Create a `.env` file in the root `auto_benchmarkcard/` directory.

The system supports multiple LLM inference engines (configured in `src/auto_benchmarkcard/config.py`):
- RITS (IBM Research Internal) - Default
- Ollama (Local inference)
- vLLM
- WML (Watson Machine Learning)

Set `LLM_ENGINE_TYPE` in `config.py` to switch between engines.

**Example for RITS:**
```bash
RITS_API_KEY=<RITS_API_KEY>
RITS_MODEL=<YOUR_MODEL>
RITS_API_URL=<RITS_API_URL>
```

---

## LLM Configuration

The pipeline uses a **tiered model strategy** — different tasks are assigned to models of appropriate size:

| Task | Model | Reason |
|------|-------|--------|
| Benchmark card composition | **DeepSeek V3.2** (default) | Requires strong instruction-following, source synthesis, and zero fabrication |
| RAG reranking & query reformulation | **Granite 3.3 8B** (default) | Simple relevance scoring — a small model is sufficient and much faster |
| Atomization (claim extraction) | **Granite 3.3 8B** | Structured extraction task, no generation creativity needed |
| FactReasoner (NLI/entailment) | **Llama 3.3 70B** | Hardcoded in the FactReasoner library config |

**Why DeepSeek V3.2 for composition?**
Earlier versions used Llama 3.3 70B, which required extensive prompt guardrails to prevent fabrication and off-topic generation. DeepSeek V3.2 follows complex multi-source instructions more reliably, produces richer paper-grounded content, and requires a much simpler prompt — reducing both maintenance overhead and failure modes.

**Changing the models:**
Set these environment variables in your `.env` file to override the defaults:
```bash
RITS_COMPOSER_MODEL=deepseek-ai/DeepSeek-V3.2
RITS_LIGHT_MODEL=ibm-granite/granite-3.3-8b-instruct
```

Install the package:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

### Step 2: Setup External Dependencies

1. Clone Merlin:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arishofmann/merlin.git external/merlin
```

### Step 3: Setup Merlin (for FactReasoner)

```bash
cd external/merlin
brew install boost
make clean
make
cd ../..
```

Verify Merlin installation:
```bash
./external/merlin/bin/merlin --help
```

```

---

## Usage

### Command Line Interface

The package installs a CLI command for processing benchmarks:

```bash
auto-benchmarkcard process <benchmark_name>
```

Examples:
```bash
auto-benchmarkcard process glue
auto-benchmarkcard process safety.truthful_qa
auto-benchmarkcard process ethos_binary
```

### Advanced Options

```bash
# Use custom UnitXT catalog
auto-benchmarkcard process glue --cataloge /path/to/custom/catalog

# Custom output directory
auto-benchmarkcard process glue --output /path/to/output

# Enable debug logging (shows detailed workflow steps)
auto-benchmarkcard process glue --debug
```

### Batch Processing

The batch script (`scripts/batch_process.py`) processes multiple benchmarks from the Unitxt catalog sequentially. Unitxt is a unified framework that provides a standardized catalog of NLP benchmarks spanning various tasks and domains (classification, QA, NLI, etc.).

The script provides:
- **Automatic catalog discovery**: Loads all benchmark cards from the Unitxt catalog using `get_catalog_items("cards")`
- **Progress tracking**: Shows real-time success rates and completion statistics
- **Smart skipping**: Automatically skips already processed benchmarks (unless `--no-skip` is specified)
- **Error handling**: Saves failed benchmarks and error messages to a JSON file for review
- **Summary statistics**: Generates detailed reports including success rates, runtime, and failure logs

```bash
python scripts/batch_process.py
```

Options:
- `--limit N`: Process only first N benchmarks (for testing)
- `--no-skip`: Reprocess already completed benchmarks
- `--output-dir DIR`: Custom output directory for batch results
- `--debug`: Enable debug logging

Example:
```bash
# Process first 10 benchmarks
python scripts/batch_process.py --limit 10

# Process all benchmarks, including already processed ones
python scripts/batch_process.py --no-skip
```

The batch script automatically tracks progress, saves statistics, and logs failed benchmarks.

### Python Module Usage

You can also run the workflow programmatically:

```python
from auto_benchmarkcard.workflow import build_workflow, OutputManager

# Create output manager
output_manager = OutputManager("glue")

# Initialize state
initial_state = {
    "query": "glue",
    "catalog_path": None,
    "output_manager": output_manager,
    "unitxt_json": None,
    "extracted_ids": None,
    "hf_repo": None,
    "hf_json": None,
    "docling_output": None,
    "composed_card": None,
    "risk_enhanced_card": None,
    "completed": [],
    "errors": [],
    "hf_extraction_attempted": False,
    "rag_results": None,
    "factuality_results": None,
}

# Execute workflow
workflow = build_workflow()
state = workflow.invoke(initial_state)
```

Or run directly:
```bash
python -m auto-benchmarkcard process glue
```

### Standalone Tool Usage

Individual tools can be used independently without running the full workflow. This is useful for integrating specific components into your own pipelines.

```python
# Fetch UnitXT benchmark metadata
from auto_benchmarkcard import unitxt_benchmark_lookup

metadata = unitxt_benchmark_lookup("glue")
print(f"Benchmark: {metadata.name}")
print(f"Description: {metadata.description}")
print(f"Subsets: {list(metadata.subsets.keys())}")
```

```python
# Get HuggingFace dataset info
from auto_benchmarkcard import hf_dataset_metadata

hf_data = hf_dataset_metadata.func("nyu-mll/glue")
print(hf_data.get("readme_markdown", "")[:500])
```

```python
# Use RAG retriever for custom evidence search
from auto_benchmarkcard import RAGRetriever, MetadataIndexer
from langchain_core.documents import Document

# Create retriever (works standalone without full config)
retriever = RAGRetriever(
    embedding_model="minilm",
    enable_llm_reranking=False,  # Disable to avoid needing LLM config
    top_k=5,
)

# Index your own documents
docs = [Document(page_content="GLUE is a benchmark for NLU tasks.")]
retriever.index_documents(docs)

# Search
results = retriever.retrieve("What is GLUE?")
```

### Provenance Tracking

The composer tool tracks the source of each generated field in the benchmark card. Provenance information is saved separately to `tool_output/composer/provenance_<name>.json`, mapping each field to its source (paper, huggingface, unitxt) and the exact evidence used.

---

## Output Files

All outputs are organized in timestamped session directories. Key files include:

### Final Benchmark Cards
`output/<name>_<timestamp>/benchmarkcard/`
- `benchmark_card_<name>.json` - Complete benchmark card with fact-checking and flagged fields

### Tool Outputs
`output/<name>_<timestamp>/tool_output/`
- `rag/formatted_rag_results_<name>.jsonl` - Evidence and atomic statements
- `ai_atlas_nexus/risks_<name>.json` - AI risk assessment results
- `factreasoner/factuality_results_<name>.json` - Factuality verification scores
- `unitxt/<name>.json` - UnitXT benchmark metadata
- `hf/<name>.json` - Hugging Face dataset metadata
- `docling/<name>.json` - Processed academic papers

---

## Logging

By default, the system runs in quiet mode showing only essential output. Use `--debug` flag to see detailed logging:

```bash
# Quiet mode (default) - minimal output
auto-benchmarkcard process glue

# Debug mode - show all workflow steps and tool logs
auto-benchmarkcard process glue --debug
```
