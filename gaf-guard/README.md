## Overview

GAF-Guard is an AI framework that can effectively detect and manage risks associated with LLMs for a given use-case. The framework leverages agents to identify risks tailored to a specific use case, generate drift and risk monitors, and establish real-time monitoring functions for LLMs. By integrating these capabilities, our approach aims to provide a comprehensive risk management framework that addresses the unique requirements of each LLM application.

A quick overview of the motivation and demonstration of the framework is here:

## Architecture

## Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)

GAF Guard utilizes the [**ACP**](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp) protocol to facilitate communication between the GAF Guard Client and Server. Any ACP-compliant client can connect to GAF Guard Server to submit tasks and retrieve outputs. By adopting the ACP protocol, GAF Guard enables seamless integration with otherwise siloed agents, promoting the creation of interoperable agentic systems that support easier collaboration and broader ecosystem connectivity.

For more information on ACP, visit the official [site](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/introduction/welcome) or check out this [blog post](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agent-communication-protocol).

## AI Atlas Nexus

GAF Guard leverages resources and APIs from **AI Atlas Nexus** to support key functions such as Risk Taxonomy, Risk Identification, Risk Questionnaire Predictions, Risk Assessment, and other AI Governance tasks. AI Atlas Nexus serves as a central platform to unify and streamline diverse tools and resources related to the governance of foundation models.

## Agentic Workflow
The present agentic workflow is as shown below.

## Documentation

See the [**GAF Guard Wiki**](https://github.com/IBM/ai-atlas-nexus-demos/wiki/GAF-Guard) for full documentation, installation guide, operational details and other information.

## Installation and Running the GAF Guard Server

1. Clone GAF Guard from `ai-atlas-nexus-demos`.
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:IBM/ai-atlas-nexus-demos.git
   cd ai-atlas-nexus-demos/gaf-guard
   ```

2. Set up your desired python virtual environment and install GAF-Guard. This project targets python version ">=3.11, <3.12". You can download specific versions of python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
   ```
   pip install -e ".[ollama]" # depending on which inference engine to use [ollama, wml, vllm]
   ```

3. Update the config variables and inference engine params in the example server config. Update LLM inference (viz. ollama, vllm) services in the config file. Example server config is given below.

   ```
   vi examples/server_configs/risk_assessment.yaml
   ```

   - In the next step, you will define the LLM credentials as environment variables or `.env` file.

4. Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying `.env.example`, and update it with the required parameters or alternatively, define the variables from `.env.example` as environment variables.

5. Start the GAF-Guard server. Select the server host and port according to your preferences.

   ```
   gaf-guard serve --config examples/server_configs/risk_assessment.yaml --host localhost --port 8000
   ```

   -  Make sure you see the following message in the terminal.
   ```
   [2026-03-16 14:45:48:224] - INFO - GAF Guard - Server v1.0.0 initialized. Listening at localhost:8000. To exit press CTRL+C
   ```

## Running the GAF Guard Client

- Streamlit Client: 
   ```
   gaf-guard client --type streamlit
   ```

   - On the streamlit UI connect screen, enter server host address and port used to start the GAF-Guard server. You can find this information in the server logs.

- CLI Client: 
   ```
   gaf-guard client --type cli --host http://localhost --port 8000
   ```
