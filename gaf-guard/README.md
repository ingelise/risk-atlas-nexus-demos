## Overview

GAF-Guard is an AI framework that can effectively detect and manage risks associated with LLMs for a given use-case. The framework leverages agents to identify risks tailored to a specific use case, generate drift and risk monitors, and establish real-time monitoring functions for LLMs. By integrating these capabilities, our approach aims to provide a comprehensive risk management framework that addresses the unique requirements of each LLM application.

A quick overview of the motivation and demonstration of the framework is here:

## Architecture

## Agent Communication Protocol (ACP)

GAF Guard utilizes the [**ACP**](https://github.com/i-am-bee/acp) protocol to facilitate communication between the GAF Guard Client and Server. Any ACP-compliant client can connect to GAF Guard Server to submit tasks and retrieve outputs. By adopting the ACP protocol, GAF Guard enables seamless integration with otherwise siloed agents, promoting the creation of interoperable agentic systems that support easier collaboration and broader ecosystem connectivity.

For more information on ACP, visit the official [site](https://agentcommunicationprotocol.dev/introduction/welcome) or check out this [blog post](https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/agent-communication-protocol).

## Risk Atlas Nexus

GAF Guard leverages resources and APIs from **Risk Atlas Nexus** to support key functions such as Risk Taxonomy, Risk Identification, Risk Questionnaire Predictions, Risk Assessment, and other AI Governance tasks. Risk Atlas Nexus serves as a central platform to unify and streamline diverse tools and resources related to the governance of foundation models.

## Agentic Workflow
The present agentic workflow is as shown below.

## Documentation

See the [**GAF Guard Wiki**](https://github.com/IBM/risk-atlas-nexus-demos/wiki/GAF-Guard) for full documentation, installation guide, operational details and other information.

## Installation and Running the CLI App

This project targets python version ">=3.11, <3.12". You can download specific versions of python here: https://www.python.org/downloads/

1. Set up `conda` or any python virtual environment and install GAF-Guard
   ```
   git clone git@github.com:IBM/risk-atlas-nexus-demos.git
   cd risk-atlas-nexus-demos/gaf-guard
   conda create -n gaf-guard python=3.11
   conda activate gaf-guard
   pip install -e ".[ollama]" # depending on which inference engine to use [ollama, wml, vllm]
   ```

2. Update the config variables and inference engine params in the server config file. Update LLM server (viz. ollama, vllm) credentials in the config file. Example server config is given below.

   - `nano examples/server_configs/risk_assessment.yaml`

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying `.env.example`, and update it with the required parameters.

4. Start the GAF-Guard server

   - `gaf-guard serve examples/server_configs/risk_assessment.yaml`

5. Start the GAF-Guard client
   - `python apps/cli/client.py --host localhost --port 8000`

6. To run benchmark on already logged JSON trajectories. `trails` directory is where all trials are stored.
   - `python apps/cli/run_benchmark.py --host localhost --port 8000 --trial-dir trials`
